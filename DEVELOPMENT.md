**Week 1 Progress**  
Found library ofxBox2d and implemented a simple simulation that involved two balls colliding.  
**Week 2 Progress**  
Created new Pendulum Simulation that simulates the movement of a simple pendulum.  
Moved the Two Balls simulation to its own class.  
Created simple object decomposition that involves putting each simulation into it's own class and having it's own setup, draw, and update methods.  
Added test cases to test simple helper functions and instantiating variable values.
