# FinalProject: A Series of Physics Simulations  
This repository contains the following simulations: 
* Two Balls Simulation
* Pendulum Simulation
* Chaotic Pendulum Simulation
* Buoyancy Simulation
* Mirror Simulation  
These simulations are intended to be for educational purposes only. Each simulation contains parameters that can be adjusted, and a simple menu allows the user to toggle between different simulations.  
Developed using openFrameworks, running these simulations requires the ofxGui and ofxBox2d libraries.
