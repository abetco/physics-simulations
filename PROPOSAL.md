# Project Proposal  
**Proposal**  
My project proposal is to create a series of physics simulations that can help demonstrate concepts in physics. Examples would include basic kinematics, demonstrating the flight of a ball given an initial velocity, as well as momentum changes in collisions. The goal is to have each physics simulation as user-friendly as possible, which entails allowing them to adjust the maximum amount of details possible for each simulation. Although I'm not too familiar with openFrameworks as of now, I imagine that my project would be able to open in multiple windows or tabs, each with its own simulation and adjustable parameters.  
  
**Extendability**  
Because it's hard to gauge exactly how much time each physics simulation will take to implement, I have not defined the specific scope of the project. Similarly, since the project is a series of simulations that can be completed one by one, it's fairly easy to have at least a couple of working parts, and if I have extra time, create more. Starting off with mechanics, I would also like to extend simulations into these areas:  
* Mechanics
* E&M
* Thermodynamics
* Relativity
* Particle Physics
* Fluid Physics  
  
In this way, the complexity is flexible. I would gander that the more advanced topics in physics would require more complexity. 
  
**Library**  
For the basic framework, my idea is to use the [newton dynamics](https://github.com/MADEAPPS/newton-dynamics) library in order to help with the mechanics simulations. Although many physics libraries are designed with game physics in mind, they can also be applied in the manner that I intend to use them in. Although I believe that I might be able to mathematically build the foundation for each of the simulations, applying this library as the infrastructure would most likely be more efficient and yield more substantial results. In addition, it would allow me more time to move on to the other topics within physics as described above.  
  
**Background**  
During high school, I thoroughly studied many concepts in physics as well as the mathematics behind them. Although I am not a physics major, I believe my knowledge in that area is sufficient for the purposes of this project. Having an understanding of what each simulation would do is important, as they are meant to be a learning tool for beginners. Additionally, although my coding experience is not extremely plentiful, a basic model isn't hard to establish, meaning that I would be able to have something done at the very least. Building upon the basics is what will help me increase the complexity of the project and increase my proficiency in coding.
