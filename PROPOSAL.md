# Project Proposal
**Proposal**
My project proposal is to create a series of physics simulations that can help demonstrate concepts in physics. Examples would include basic kinematics, demonstrating the flight of a ball given an initial velocity, as well as momentum changes in collisions. The goal is to have each physics simulation as user-friendly as possible, which entails allowing them to adjust the maximum amount of details possible for each simulation. 
**Extendability**
Because it's hard to gauge exactly how much time each physics simulation will take to implement, I have not defined the specific scope of the project. Similarly, since the project is a series of simulations that can be completed one by one, it's fairly easy to have at least a couple of working parts, and if I have extra time, create more. Starting off with mechanics, I would also like to extend simulations into areas of E&M, thermodynamics, and modern physics. 
**Background**
During high school, I thoroughly studied many concepts in physics
**Library**
For the basic framework, my idea is to use the [newton dynamics](https://github.com/MADEAPPS/newton-dynamics) library in order to help with basic
